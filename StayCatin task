My task is to assist the business management in making informed decisions based on the provided data, 
which includes property details, reviews, and price fluctuations over time. 
To address their key questions, I'm tasked with creating a dashboard that provides insights into the following:
1.Top 10 earners.
2.The correlation between price and earnings.
3.Locations with higher earnings.
4.The relationship between price and reviews. 
Alongside the dashboard, I'll also develop a storyboard to showcase the insights derived from the data analysis.
